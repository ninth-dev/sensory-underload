# Sensory Underload

A different take on syntax highlighting for Sublime Text.

## Installation

### Through Package Control

_Thanks to [Justin Lam](https://github.com/ninth-dev) for this solution_.

1. cmd + shift + p
1. type in : pcar ( Package Control: Add Repository )
1. paste in : https://github.com/ssanj/sensory-underload
1. cmd + shift + p
1. type in: pcip ( Package Control: Install Package )
1. type in: sensory-underloaded

### Clone and Modify Locally

1. Clone this repo
1. Symlink checkout under your Sublime Text Packages directory

    You can find your packages directory by going to `Preferences` > `Browse Packages`.

    On Macos it should be `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages`


## Usage

You should now see the following UI color schemes under `UI: Select Color Scheme` in the command palette:
1. Scala to the Min (Specially built for Scala)
1. Free your mind (Almost no highlighting at all)
1. Scala Light


Consider installing the `scala-sensory-underload.sublime-syntax` for your scala files for a more customised experience.
