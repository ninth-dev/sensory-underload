# Sensory Underload

A different take on syntax highlighting for Sublime Text.

## Installation

The easiest way to use this Colour Scheme is to:
1. Clone this repo
2. Symlink checkout under your Sublime Text Packages directory

You can find your packages directory by going to `Preferences` > `Browse Packages`.

On Macos it should be `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages`


You should now see the "sensory-underload" package's themes:
1. Scala to the Min (Specially built for Scala)
1. Free your mind (Almost no highlighting at all)
